# Features that could be implemented:

## My Perks
- This will be a collection of perks that you have selected for your character.
- Each perk in the main list should have an "add to My Perks" button
    - When clicked, this perk will be moved to the My Perks page
- Similarly, each perk in the My Perks list should have a "remove from My Perks" button
    - This can operate in the same way as adding and removing 'todo' tasks from 'daily-planner' project
- This information should be stored in the local storage
